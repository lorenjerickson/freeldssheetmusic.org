TODO tag the parent if the parent has tags :)
  also if they tag the parent but its children have options...it should tag a child I guess...except primary original songs though...hmm...

if it has children options should it require them?
  I guess not until we have dual parented tags...

Primary with instrument" should also be tagged "instrumental"
