<H2>Step up program description</H2>
<H2>Trade School Tuition loan</H2>
Hello all.
<p>
We're pleased to announce our new system called the 'step up' program.
Basically, we help people to graduate from "trade schools", for instance:
certified nursing assistant training (allows you to work in rest homes), takes 6 weeks or so.  Then you can get a new different job, possibly with better hours, probably with higher than minimum wage pay.  Possibly a job that you can like more.  It's great to get some education, instead of treading water where you currently are today.  If you're unemployed, that might be a good time to get training, also.
<p>
<p>
<a href=http://www.mlatc.edu/programs/areas-of-study>http://www.mlatc.edu/programs/areas-of-study</a> lists a bunch more possible programs, some of which might work. (No we are not affiliated with the mlatc, they are just a good local trade school).  Other local trade/certificate schools might work as well.
<p>

What's the benefit?

<p>
If you get a certification, even for a CNA, it opens up a lot more job possibilities to you (you can search for cna on craigslist--there are people looking for workers).  You can get more than minimum wage paying job, too.  You may also be able to apply for a wider range of jobs, and thus find one more easily.  And it may be a more stable job, etc.  Basically, we're offering this as an escape hatch for those that are stuck in a bad job, or that are stuck without a job.
<p>
One option is to train for "lesser paying" jobs first, then get a job in them, then use the new income to go back and get more schooling, to end up with the job you're looking for.  We may be able to help with that.  YOU CAN TELL YOUR FRIENDS ABOUT THIS TOO :)
<p>
What's the catch?  
<p>
Basically we ask you to, once you're done with the training, and get your new job (in that field or even not), to pay us back 3 fold the cost of tuition, over time, as you can (kind of like how government student loans work--you don't pay until afer your schooling is complete, presumably once you have your new job).  The 3x repayment is so that we can give tuition to more future participants (it's to keep the system going, so that others can benefit, and also weed out applicants that aren't that serious--you're helping others enter the step up program, basically).  You only pay it back *after* you get another job, so you'll still be making more money than the cost to repay it.  After, of course, you keep the certification and the new job, and we go our separate ways.

<p>
Also if you need a small stipend while you are attending (for gas, for instance, or bus pass to get around) that might be a possibility also.  If you need babysitting for short term training, we recommend asking for volunteers from your "local church congregation" (ex: asking the Relief Society President to ask if there are any volunteers), obviously friends and family would help with sitting, too.  Another interesting resource is, if you're out of work, or might leave your current job for training, you might be able to get help for necessities, while you are training, for instance from a local Bishop.
<p>
Other training options:
<p>
If you are super "tech savvy" or "love to play computer games" then I could set you up with a private course for learning how to computer program. (take a free course I could offer you, basically)
<p>
If you want to learn to be a secretary, I could set you up with a course to learn Excel, QuickBooks, etc. (free course)
<p>
If you are a mechanic we could help you get ASE certified. (pretty cheap)
<p>
If you think that managing computer programmers (the people) and their computer program tasks would be fun (you don't have to be techy) then I could help with getting your PMP Certification (Project Management Professional).  This one takes a lot of studying though you'd need to be really serious about it, and reasonably smart.  It's reasonably difficult, or so I'm told.  It may also have higher pay.
<p>
If you are an art/graphic design person, we could help you learn some web design. (free)
<p>
Classes from UVU <a href="http://www.uvu.edu/ce/">continuing education</a> (professional/community) would also possibly work well.
<p>
Also if you need a "micro loan" to buy for instance some equipment for a job or to start your own business (example that comes to mind is a large [used] lawn mower to start your own yard care business, that might work).  Same repayment policy (3x).  Or a micro loan to get a bus pass so you can reach your work.
<p>
If there is any certification you might like, that just requires passing a test, we'd be happy to buy the training books for you, at no charge, then pay for the test for you.  You pass the test, we keep the books so we can use them for future people (ex: a+ cert., networking+., etc...)

<h2>Application</h2>

<p>
We are looking for honest, reliable, dependable people for this loan.  It's basically an "on your honor" trust thing that you'll repay it.
We are local, living in Orem near Macey's on 8th North.
We look forward to hearing from you.
Basically tell us your "story/status" and course desired if we feel you merit it, we'll accept your request and proceed to set up a course (we pay direct to the schools) for you.  We don't typically pay for "normal" school degree seeking tuition (like UVU).

<p>
If you're uneasy about if we're honest about this, we can give you some references for people we have worked with before (with other programs, not this one specifically).

<p>
Sometimes classes are day classes, sometimes night classes.

<p>
Note that we love applicants who are parents (or single parents), and others.  Also even if you're older, training can still help a lot!  It's about the job, not your age, typically, to the employer.

Male or female applicants ok.

<h2>Contact</h2>
Contact if interested or for more info/any questions: <a href="mailto:rogerpack2005@gmail.com?subject=step%20up%20application">email us</a>.

<p>
Thanks and good luck with everything, even if this isn't what you're looking for, best wishes, and thanks for reading! 

<p>
