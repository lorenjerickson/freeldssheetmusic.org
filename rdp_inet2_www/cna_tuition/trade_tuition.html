<H2>Tuition scholarship</H2>
<p>As an effort to help others who can't easily afford to retrain (or don't have a job), we have decided to offer some assistance.  Basically you work for us on the weekends, we'll pay for your schooling/food et al.

<p>
Consider this an opportunity to switch careers.  If you have an "ideal" career that you'd like to be in, this may be your chance.  Of course we prefer to fund "cheaper" courses like technical courses from the <a href="http://www.mlatc.edu/areas-of-study/programs.html">MATC</a>, which has several courses, from CDL to medical assistant to nails and culinary arts (of course, some courses are more intense/longer schooling than others, and some jobs are more in demand than others, and some jobs pay differently than others).  You can lookup job pay scales <a href="http://www.indeed.com/salary">here</a> by searching for the type of job and entering "orem, ut" I'd recommend choosing the course that you'd like to work at the most.  Also going back to school at UVU is an option (they have an open enrollment policy).  
</p>

<p>
The reason we're doing this is as a community service for those who would like to work a job they'd enjoy more, but don't have the up front funds to go to the schooling.  That's where we come in.  We have some extra funds, so thought, why not help some people out?  Because we don't believe in giving out handouts, though, we request that you work for us for the cost of tuition "before hand" (for example, the Saturday's before your semester begins, work for us, then we'd pay tuition plus a stipend during that semester, and also during the semester you'd work for us on weekends too, saving up for the next semester, etc.).  We're flexible, but you could probably come to our house and do household tasks (cleaning, gardening, maybe some building, painting, depending on what you want to do/can do).  Divide the total tuition cost by 10 and that's the number of hours you'll have to put in.  You can work anytime, really, according to your schedule.  
<p>
If you need help with transport costs, we may be able to work something in.
</p>

<h2>How to apply</h2>
<p>
Basically tell us your "story" and if we feel you merit it, we'll accept your request and proceed to set up a work schedule.

<p>
If you're uneasy about if we're honest about this, we can give you some references for people who have done the program before, and you can ask them about their experience if you'd like. 

<p>
If needed, we might even pay for child care while you're at school.  As Kirby Heyborne would say, "It's all about you."  You'd need to work more hours but not too many more.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes classes are day classes, sometimes night classes.
</p>

<p>
Note that we give preference to applicants who are parents, though you might could talk us into it even if you're not one.  Give it a shot why not? :)  Also even if you're older, training can help a lot!  It's about the job, not your age, typically.
</p>
<p>
Male or female applicants ok.
<p>
<p>
List of MATC programs: automotive technology, CNA, comercial truck driving, diesel mechanics, emissions test preparation,
vehicle safety inspection, UDOT flagging, Business technology, computer literacy, data entry, business/hr resource management, typing, microsoft office/quickbooks, CPR, first aid, Dental Assistant, EMT, Medical assistant, medical billing and coding, medical office administration, CNA, LPN, Pharmacy Tech, Phlebotomy, IT intro, Barbering, Culinary arts, composite materials, cosmetology, nail techician, welding.
<p>
Our funds are limited, so we prefer to fund MATC (cheaper) but are reasonably open to other suggestions/schools, so give it a shot.

Other options:

Life Guarding (good for part time, if you like swimming/know how to) <a href="www.utahredcross.org/general_calltoaction.asp?CTA=2&SN=3009&OP=3013&IDCapitulo=I2OD6QV708">click here</a> for red cross program info.

If you are "very tech savvy" or "love to play computer games" then I could set you up with a program for learning how to program.  There are lots of programmer jobs out there.

If you want to learn to be a secretary, I could set you up with a course to learn Excel, QuickBooks, etc.

Classes from UVU <a href="http://www.uvu.edu/ce/">continuing education</a> (professional/community) would also probably work well.

Also if you need a "micro loan" to buy for instance some equipment for a job or to start your own business (example that comes to mind is a large [used] lawn mower to start your own yard care business, that might work).
