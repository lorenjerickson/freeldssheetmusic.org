substruct site for freeldssheetmusic.org (rails 2.3.8)

To use, download, then create your vendor dir like this:

now create config/database.yml with mysql parameters, then run

$ rake gems:install # possibly don't need anymore.
$ rake db:create
$ rake substruct:db:bootstrap
$ rake db:migrate

and it should be ready.

But really you can just email us comments/concerns about the site rogerdpack@gmail.com :)
