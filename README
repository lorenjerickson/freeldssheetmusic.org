substruct site for freeldssheetmusic.org (rails 2.3.8)

To use, download, then create your vendor dir like this:

now create config/database.yml with mysql parameters, then run

# first install ruby enterprise edition, then...

$ gem update --system 1.3.7 or some odd
$ gem uninstall rake
$ gem install rake -v 0.8.7
$ gem install os
$ gem uninstall rack # and reinstall v 1.1.6 -- or do we get the reinstall for free with gems:install perhaps...
$ rake gems:install # still needed I think, this is a mess, some are vendored, some have to be installed for native, some have both what?
$ gem install sundawg_premailer # bundled but shouldn't be, etc.
$ rake db:create # unless you already did, depending on how you setup the mysql DB
# now either the following, or load a dump
$ rake substruct:db:bootstrap
$ rake db:migrate

and it should be ready.
